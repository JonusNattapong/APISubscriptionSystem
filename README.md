# AI Model Subscription System

A comprehensive platform for AI model deployment, synchronization, and subscription management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1️⃣ File Synchronization Tool (Rust)
- Monitors AI model files for changes
- Syncs files to cloud storage (Google Drive, AWS S3)
- Provides encryption and compression
- Ensures efficient and secure file management

### 2️⃣ AI Model API Service (Python)
- Serves AI models via REST API
- Manages user subscriptions and authentication
- Handles usage tracking and rate limiting
- Supports various AI models (Mistral, Llama, Whisper, Stable Diffusion)

## 💰 Subscription Plans

- **Starter**: $10/month (10,000 words)
- **Pro**: $50/month (100,000 words)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing based on usage
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Usage-based pricing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Python 3.9+
- Google Cloud or AWS account
- Stripe account for payment processing

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up the Rust file sync tool (see `/rust-file-sync/README.md`)
